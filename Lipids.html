					Lipids
				</h2>
					<p id="indent">Lipids are a diverse group of organic compounds that include fats, oils, hormones, 
						and certain components of membranes. According to Thompson (2023), they are grouped because 
						they do not interact appreciably with water. Lipids have been known to humans for thousands of 
						years. The ancient Egyptians used animal fat as a cosmetic and the Greeks used olive oil for 
						cooking and lighting. In 1815, Henri Braconnot classified lipids into two categories, suifs 
						(solid greases or tallow) and huiles (fluid oils). Michel Eugène Chevreul developed a more 
						detailed classification in 1823, including oils, greases, tallow, waxes, resins, balsams, and 
						volatile oils (or essential oils). Because lipids are mostly made up of hydrocarbons in their 
						most reduced state, which oxidizes to release substantial amounts of energy when digested, they 
						are a good source of stored energy (Greenwood, 2023). They also help in the absorption of 
						vitamins and minerals and are involved in the synthesis of hormones.

				<h2>
					Structure and Function
				</h2>
					<p id="indent">An integral part of the cell membrane are lipids. Typically, the structure consists of a hydrophobic 
						fatty acid tail, a phosphate group, and a glycerol backbone (hydrophilic). Phospholipids are hence amphipathic. 
						Phospholipids are grouped in a bilayer in the cell membrane, which protects the cell and acts as a barrier to 
						specific chemicals. The hydrophobic portion faces within, while the hydrophilic portion faces outside. Monitoring 
						which molecules can enter and exit the cell is made easier by this configuration. For instance, it is simple for 
						nonpolar molecules and tiny polar molecules to diffuse into and out of cells, such as oxygen and water. Meanwhile, 
						transport proteins are necessary to let large, polar molecules—like glucose—pass readily. Esters with different 
						lengths and saturation levels of three fatty acids and glycerol make up fats and oils. Fatty acids help absorb 
						fat-soluble vitamins, store energy, and insulate cells.
						The term unsaturated indicates that fewer than the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms are bonded to each carbon in the molecule. The number of double bonds 
						is indicated by the generic name—monounsaturated for molecules with one double bond or polyunsaturated for molecules 
						with two or more double bonds. Oleic acid is an example of a monounsaturated fatty acid (Thompson, 2023).
						Lipids, as highlighted by Fujimoto, Ohsaki, Cheng, Suzuki, and Shinohara (2008), play a multifaceted and pivotal 
						role in a variety of biological processes.

				<h2>
					Importance in Cellular Function
				</h2>
					<p id="indent">Lipids are a large group of different molecules that are very important for the structure and function of cells and 
						are a big part of cell walls. Lipids are amphiphilic, which means their heads like water and their tails don't. They 
						can then form a two-layer structure that keeps the inside and outside of cells separate. This two-layer structure acts 
						as a wall to keep chemicals inside and outside the cell, which is important for keeping the cell healthy and whole 
						(Müller et al., 2008).As part of a cell membrane’s structural composition, lipids contribute in regulating the cell’s 
						interactions with certain molecules and proteins. Lipids determine the membrane permeability barrier of cells and 
						their organelles (Bogdanov et al., 2008). Lipids also act as an anchor to embed proteins to the membrane and control 
						the folding, organization, and structure of membrane proteins. Thus, lipids affect a cell’s permeability, fluidity, and 
						interaction with proteins that ultimately contribute to a cell’s normal functioning. Further, lipids are also significant 
						in intracellular homeostasis. A cellular process called autophagy through which unwanted or damaged components of a cell 
						are disassembled and repurposed, is dependent on the metabolism of lipids.

				<h2>
					Health Implications
				</h2>
					<p id="indent">
						Lipids, a diverse group of molecules, play indispensable roles in human physiology, serving as energy reservoirs, 
						structural components of cell membranes, precursors to hormones, facilitators of vitamin absorption, and crucial 
						elements of nerve function. Despite their essentiality, maintaining healthy lipid levels is paramount for overall 
						well-being. Excessive consumption of certain types of lipids can lead to a cascade of adverse health consequences, 
						including cardiovascular disease, obesity, fatty liver disease, and inflammatory conditions (Grundy & Stone, 2004). 
						Lipids are vital for the proper functioning of organisms. Maintaining a balance in lipid intake and composition is 
						crucial for overall health and well-being. However, an imbalance or excess of certain lipids can contribute to health 
						issues, emphasizing the importance of a balanced and nutritious diet. From the study of Vieira, Zhang, and Decker 
						(2017), nearly every food that contains fat has the ability to experience lipid oxidation, even if unsaturated amounts
						 of fatty acids are minimal. As a result, eating foods high in unsaturated fats, foods that have undergone 
						 significant heat processing, or foods high in pro-oxidants may increase the likelihood of consuming lipid oxidation 
						 products.
