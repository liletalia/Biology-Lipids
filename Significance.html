					Biochemical Processes
				</h2>
					<p id="indent">Biochemical processes are the chemical reactions that serve as the basis of all 
                        the cellular processes inside an organism. According to Rollo and Gillaspy (2023), these 
                        processes are involved in synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones, the breakdown of 
                        biological molecules into simpler ones, and the alteration of biomolecules to create new 
                        molecules. These processes are essential for all living organisms, as they provide the energy 
                        and raw materials needed for growth, development, and reproduction. For lipids, these involve 
                        lipogenesis, lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, eicosanoid synthesis, cholesterol metabolism, 
                        lipid transport, membrane biogenesis, lipid signaling, lipid remodeling, and lipid peroxidation.

                <p id="indent"> The term "metabolism" alludes to all of the chemical processes that occur within a cell.
                    In order to maintain its own viability and the health of the entire organism, cells are continually 
                    engaged in millions of chemical processes. Frequently, these chemical reactions are connected in 
                    chains or pathways (Berg, Tymoczko, & Stryer, 2002).  These pathways can also be classified as a 
                    “metabolic pathway”. 
                    A study done by Baron (2022) insists that for the living thing that is executing them, metabolic 
                    pathways are crucial. The energy, resources, and substances required by the body's cells are 
                    produced through the metabolic processes. The metabolic pathways incorporate a sequence of processes
                    where the intermediate metabolites are continually renewed and the substrate is continuously 
                    reconstructed.

                    Disruptions in metabolism can lead to various health-related issues such as diabetes, Gaucher’s 
                    disease, and hemochromatosis (Kandola, 2023). These metabolic disorders can cause different 
                    symptoms and complications within the body, including tiredness, weight loss or gain, and nausea 
                    and vomiting.

                    Lipids are also involved in many clinical researches and experiments and medical applications. 
                    Up until recently, lipids were solely associated with energy and structural roles. However, new 
                    research has shown that they are also heavily involved in biological processes, prompting the 
                    development of a new field of study called lipidomics. Researchers have managed to delve deeper 
                    into the functions of lipids and demonstrate how they can aid in the regulation of inflammation 
                    and the immune system, neuronal function, or even provide alternatives to disrupt the energy 
                    metabolism of tumors, despite the possibility that they are the cause of obesity or cardiovascular 
                    diseases (Rodriguez-Alcala, Pimentel, & Vidigal, 2021).
